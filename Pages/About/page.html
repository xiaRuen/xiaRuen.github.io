            <p>
                As an computer scientist, I strive to make an impact on the world through
                the manipulation of logic. Currently focoused on computer vision and
                machine learning, basic knowledge have been acquired and now waiting for
                it to grow and bloom into an impact.

                As an artist, I am exploring how art gives meaning in the macroscopic aspects
                such as color, scene composiiton. With the skill of 3D modeling in hand, and
                digital art in pursue, my understandings regularly updates, about the bridges
                which connects our minds.

                Traditinoal sciences explore our world but computer science creates a world.

                From a very young age, I developed a logical and imaginative mind. At 12, I built paper models of a
                battleship from the side and top view images. At that time, I didnâ€™t know about the Pythagorean
                theorem, so I would draw two points on paper(scaled-down), then use a ruler to find the hypotenuse.
                When I first encountered the algorithm problem of finding all possible path to finish when one can
                only move right and down, I was able to come up with an optimized dynamic programming solution.
                Similarly, I was able to use sum to infinity formula to solve a Markov Chain problem without
                understanding of Markov and matrices.
